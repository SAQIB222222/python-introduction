    "\n",
    "13.Some of the benefits of using Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a high-level programming language that is easy to learn and use.\n",

    "It can be used for a wide range of applications, from web development to scientific computing and data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is cross-platform and can run on various operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "14.Memory management in Python is handled by the Python interpreter's memory manager. It uses a private heap to manage memory allocation and deallocation, and it also has a garbage collector that automatically frees up memory that is no longer in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "15.To install Python on Windows and set path variables, you can follow these steps:\n",
